## Introduction

DataStax Astra is a cloud-native database built on Apache Cassandraâ„¢. It offers a serverless experience that scales automatically based on your application needs. Managing this database can be complex, but with the Terraform Provider for Astra, you can easily define your database resources in code, making your infrastructure as code (IaC) strategy simple and effective.

## Features

- **Full Lifecycle Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for Astra databases.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Take advantage of Astra's serverless capabilities.
- **Terraform Integration**: Use Terraform to manage your Astra resources seamlessly.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define your database resources in a simple, declarative way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- An active DataStax Astra account. You can sign up for a free tier [here](https://astra.datastax.com/register).
- Basic knowledge of Terraform and infrastructure as code concepts.

### Installation

To install the Terraform Provider for Astra, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/theKamikaze28gm/terraform-provider-astra/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file and place the provider binary in your Terraform plugins directory.

## Usage

### Basic Configuration

To use the provider, you need to define it in your Terraform configuration file. Here is a basic example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    astra = {
      source  = "theKamikaze28gm/astra"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "astra" {
  token = var.astra_token
}

resource "astra_database" "example" {
  name      = "example_db"
  keyspace  = "example_keyspace"
  region    = "us-west-2"
  instance_type = "serverless"
}
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s a more detailed example of how to use the provider:

```hcl
variable "astra_token" {
  description = "Your DataStax Astra token"
  type        = string
}

provider "astra" {
  token = var.astra_token
}

resource "astra_database" "my_database" {
  name        = "my_database"
  keyspace    = "my_keyspace"
  region      = "us-east-1"
  instance_type = "serverless"
}

resource "astra_keyspace" "my_keyspace" {
  name = "my_keyspace"
  database_id = astra_database.my_database.id
}
```

This example creates a new database and keyspace in Astra. Adjust the parameters according to your needs.
